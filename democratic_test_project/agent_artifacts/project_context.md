# Project: Modern Web Dashboard for Data Visualization

**Project Goal:** Develop a modern, responsive web dashboard for real-time data visualization.

**Key Requirements:**

*   **Real-time data updates:** The dashboard must display data updates in real-time.
*   **Mobile-responsive design:** The dashboard should be accessible and usable on various devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).
*   **Maintainability:** The application should be designed for long-term maintainability (2+ years).  The chosen technologies should have good community support and readily available resources.
*   **SEO Considerations:**  The application should be optimized for search engines to improve discoverability.

**Decision to be made:** Selection of a frontend framework. This decision will significantly impact the project's long-term success and should be made collaboratively.

**Decision Process:** A democratic decision-making process will be used.  All team members (Project Manager, Developer, Researcher, Tester) will participate in proposing and voting on the framework.

**Next Steps:** Each team member will submit their proposal for the frontend framework, detailing their reasoning and justification.
