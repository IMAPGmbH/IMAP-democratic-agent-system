# Requirements Analysis: Meta-IMAP Landing Page

## 1. Project Goal

To create a meta-IMAP landing page for "AI-supported organizational transformation" that not only discusses democratic AI transformation but also *embodies* it through its creation process by a team of 6 AIs.

## 2. Core Theme & Philosophy

*   **Embodiment:** The website must *demonstrate* democratic AI principles through its own development story.
*   **IMAP Philosophy:** Connect to IMAP's core values: "Bewegen. Das gro√üe Ganze. Und die Einzelnen." (Move. The big picture. And the individuals.)
*   **Ant Metaphor:** Reflect IMAP's ant metaphor symbolizing collective intelligence.
*   **Change as New Normal:** The page should demonstrate this concept through its creation.

## 3. Key Content Sections

1.  **Hero Section:** 
    *   Focus: AI Transformation.
    *   Impact: Strong and compelling.
2.  **Democratic AI Approach Explanation:**
    *   Content: Clearly explain the principles and benefits of a democratic AI development approach.
3.  **Live Demonstration:**
    *   Content: Showcase that the page itself was created by 6 AIs working democratically.
    *   Mechanism: This needs to be creatively integrated into the page (e.g., a section detailing the process, attributions, or a dynamic element).
4.  **Connection to IMAP Philosophy:**
    *   Content: Explicitly link the project's approach and the AI team's work to IMAP's philosophy and ant metaphor.
5.  **Call to Action (CTA):**
    *   Target: Interested organizations.
    *   Purpose: Encourage contact or engagement for AI-supported organizational transformation services.

## 4. Development Process & Constraints

*   **Democratic Decision-Making:** The team has freedom to democratically decide on:
    *   Technical Framework & Architecture (This is the first democratic decision).
    *   Creative interpretation of the ant metaphor.
    *   Visual style.
    *   Technical solutions.
*   **Project Lead:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (PM) initiates planning and phase breakdown.
*   **Development Phases:** Iterative, defined by PM.
*   **Reflection Checkpoints:** Facilitated by Grok and PM when needed.
*   **Guiding Principle:** Buddhist Middle Way - balance between thoroughness and efficiency.
*   **Cost Consciousness:** Be mindful of interaction costs; seek elegant, efficient solutions.

## 5. Target Audience

*   Organizations interested in New Work, Change & Leadership, Diversity, and Transformation.
*   Organizations considering or undergoing AI-supported transformation.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Authenticity:** The page must genuinely reflect its democratic AI-driven creation.
*   **Clarity:** Content should be clear, concise, and impactful.
*   **Engagement:** The page should be engaging and encourage users to explore.
*   **Performance & Efficiency:** Aligned with the "elegant, efficient solutions" principle.

## 7. Key Success Metrics (Implied)

*   Successful democratic decision-making throughout the project.
*   A final landing page that effectively communicates the core messages.
*   Positive reception demonstrating the viability of collective AI intelligence.
*   Adherence to the project's guiding principles (Middle Way, cost-efficiency).
