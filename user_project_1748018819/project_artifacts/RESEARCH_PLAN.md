# Research Plan: Meta-IMAP Landing Page

**Objective:** To gather necessary information to inform the democratic decision-making process for the technical architecture, visual style, and content strategy of the Meta-IMAP landing page.

**Lead Researcher:** Gemini 1.5 Flash

**Supporting Team:** All agents are encouraged to contribute insights based on their expertise.

## Research Areas:

1.  **IMAP In-Depth (Responsibility: Gemini 1.5 Flash)**
    *   **Task:** Thoroughly analyze the existing IMAP website (if a URL is provided or found) focusing on:
        *   Their current branding, visual style, and tone of voice.
        *   Detailed explanation and representation of their philosophy: "Bewegen. Das große Ganze. Und die Einzelnen."
        *   Current use and depiction of the ant metaphor.
        *   Services offered: New Work, Change & Führung, Diversität, Transformation.
        *   Target audience communication.
    *   **Output:** A summary document highlighting key findings, visual elements, and core messaging. Identify potential areas for the new landing page to connect with or subtly evolve from.
    *   **Estimated Cost:** €0.50 (for potential scraping, analysis)

2.  **Landing Page Best Practices for Transformation Services (Responsibility: Gemini 1.5 Flash)**
    *   **Task:** Research best practices for landing pages that promote consultancy or transformation services, especially in the context of AI and organizational change.
        *   Effective hero section designs.
        *   Compelling CTAs for B2B services.
        *   Methods for showcasing unique processes or philosophies (like our democratic AI approach).
    *   **Output:** A concise report with examples and actionable recommendations.
    *   **Estimated Cost:** €0.75 (for search queries, potential scraping of example sites)

3.  **Creative Interpretations of "Collective Intelligence" & "Ant Metaphor" (Responsibility: All Agents, facilitated by Gemini 1.5 Flash for initial collection)
    *   **Task:** Brainstorm and research visual and conceptual interpretations of collective intelligence, specifically relating to the ant metaphor, but also open to other creative ideas that align with the project's theme.
        *   How can this be visually represented in a modern, tech-forward way?
        *   How can it tie into the "AI team" concept?
    *   **Output:** A mood board or collection of ideas and visual inspirations. This will be a key input for the visual style decision.
    *   **Estimated Cost:** €0.50 (for search queries for inspirational material)

4.  **Showcasing "AI-Driven Democratic Process" (Responsibility: All Agents, facilitated by Gemini 1.5 Flash for initial collection)
    *   **Task:** Research and propose innovative ways to demonstrate *on the landing page itself* that it was built by a team of 6 AIs working democratically.
        *   Examples: Interactive elements, a 'making-of' section, dynamic content reflecting agent contributions, a visual representation of the decision process.
    *   **Output:** A list of feasible and creative ideas for team discussion.
    *   **Estimated Cost:** €0.25 (for search queries)

## Timeline for Initial Research:

*   **To be completed before the first democratic decision on technical architecture.** (Suggesting a short timeframe, e.g., 1-2 work cycles, PM to specify).

## Budget Allocation for Research Phase:

*   Total Estimated: €2.00

## Next Steps Post-Research:

*   Researcher (Gemini 1.5 Flash) presents findings to the team.
*   PM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) facilitates a discussion to synthesize research insights.
*   Team proceeds to the first democratic decision: Technical Architecture.
