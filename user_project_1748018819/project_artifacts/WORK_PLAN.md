# Work Plan: Meta-IMAP Landing Page

**Project Goal:** Develop and launch a landing page for "AI-supported organizational transformation" that embodies democratic AI principles in its creation.

**Guiding Principles:** Buddhist Middle Way (Thoroughness & Efficiency), Democratic Collaboration, Cost-Effectiveness.

## Phases:

**Phase 0: Initial Planning & Setup (Current Phase)**
*   **Lead:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (PM)
*   **Activities:**
    *   Analyze user requirements.
    *   Create initial planning artifacts (Requirements Analysis, Research Plan, Work Plan, Step Breakdown, Access Matrix Template).
    *   Define project structure and communication protocols.
*   **Output:** Foundational project documents, team alignment on initial steps.
*   **Estimated Cost:** €0.10 (PM's internal processing and file operations)

**Phase 1: Research & Foundation**
*   **Lead:** Gemini 1.5 Flash (Researcher), supported by all team members.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Execute tasks outlined in `RESEARCH_PLAN.md`:
        *   IMAP in-depth analysis.
        *   Landing page best practices for transformation services.
        *   Creative interpretations of "collective intelligence" & "ant metaphor."
        *   Ideas for showcasing the "AI-Driven Democratic Process."
    *   Presentation of research findings to the team.
*   **Output:** Research summaries, mood boards, inspirational materials. Shared understanding of IMAP's context and relevant best practices.
*   **Trigger for Next Phase:** Completion and review of research findings.
*   **Estimated Cost:** €2.00 (as per Research Plan)

**Phase 2: Democratic Decision - Technical Architecture & Visual Direction**
*   **Lead:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (Facilitator), Grok (Reflector)
*   **Participants:** All team members.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Democratic Decision 1: Technical Architecture:**
        *   PM triggers formal decision process.
        *   Agents propose and discuss potential frameworks/architectures (e.g., static site generator, specific frontend framework, headless CMS, etc.).
        *   Voting and selection of the technical architecture.
        *   **Context for decision:** Simplicity, ease of collaboration for AI agents, performance, and ability to showcase the democratic creation process. Cost of development and deployment.
    *   **Democratic Decision 2: Visual Style & Ant Metaphor Interpretation:**
        *   PM triggers formal decision process.
        *   Based on research (mood boards, IMAP analysis), agents propose and discuss visual styles and creative interpretations of the ant metaphor.
        *   Voting and selection of the overall visual direction.
*   **Output:** Agreed-upon technical architecture. Agreed-upon visual style guide/principles and concept for ant metaphor.
*   **Trigger for Next Phase:** Successful completion of democratic decisions.
*   **Estimated Cost:** €0.50 (for triggering decisions, agent participation in proposing/voting - assuming minimal interaction cost per agent for this step)

**Phase 3: Content Strategy & Initial Prototyping**
*   **Lead:** Development Team (Claude 4 Sonnet, Codestral), supported by all.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Develop detailed content outlines for each section based on `REQUIREMENTS_ANALYSIS.md` and research.
    *   Draft initial copy for key sections (Hero, Democratic AI explanation, IMAP connection, CTA).
    *   Create basic wireframes or low-fidelity prototypes based on the chosen architecture and visual direction.
    *   Develop a plan for the "live demonstration" component.
*   **Output:** Content outlines, draft copy, basic wireframes/prototypes. Clear plan for the "live demo" feature.
*   **Reflection Point:** Grok & PM to review progress and team alignment. Potential democratic decision if significant disagreements on content direction arise.
*   **Estimated Cost:** €2.00 (for content generation, wireframing - assuming AI-assisted content generation)

**Phase 4: Iterative Development & Implementation**
*   **Lead:** Development Team (Claude 4 Sonnet, Codestral)
*   **Debugger:** Codestral
*   **Tester:** Mistral Medium
*   **Activities:**
    *   Iteratively build the landing page components based on chosen architecture, visual style, and content.
    *   Implement the five key sections: Hero, Democratic AI, Live Demo, IMAP Philosophy, CTA.
    *   Integrate the chosen interpretation of the ant metaphor.
    *   Regular code reviews and debugging.
    *   Continuous testing by Mistral Medium.
*   **Output:** A functional, progressively developed landing page.
*   **Reflection Point:** Regular check-ins. Grok & PM to facilitate reflection if development hits roadblocks or if new democratic decisions are needed (e.g., on specific implementation details if conflicts arise).
*   **Estimated Cost:** €3.50 (core development effort, assuming efficient component-based development)

**Phase 5: Finalization, Testing & Review**
*   **Lead:** Mistral Medium (Tester), Development Team, PM.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Comprehensive testing: functionality, usability, responsiveness, cross-browser compatibility (if applicable).
    *   Content review and refinement.
    *   Final review by all team members for adherence to requirements and democratic principles.
    *   Address any outstanding bugs or issues.
*   **Output:** A polished, tested, and finalized landing page ready for 'deployment' (conceptual, as we are AIs).
*   **Reflection Point:** Grok & PM to lead a final project reflection: What worked well? What could be improved in our democratic AI process?
*   **Estimated Cost:** €1.00 (for testing, final reviews, minor fixes)

**Phase 6: Project Completion & Handover (Conceptual)**
*   **Lead:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (PM)
*   **Activities:**
    *   Package all project artifacts and the final landing page code/assets.
    *   Prepare a final report summarizing the process and outcomes, highlighting the democratic AI aspect.
*   **Output:** Completed project deliverables.
*   **Estimated Cost:** €0.10 (for final packaging and reporting)

## Estimated Total Project Cost: €9.20

*(Note: Cost estimations are very high-level and aim to guide efficient use of resources. Actual costs will depend on the complexity of democratic decisions and the number of iterations.)*
