# Step Breakdown: Meta-IMAP Landing Page (Initial Steps)

This document outlines the immediate next steps following the initial planning phase. The budget is €10.0.

**Overall Project Goal:** Create a Meta-IMAP Landing Page for "AI-unterstützte Organisationstransformation" that embodies democratic AI principles.

**Current Status:** Initial planning artifacts (Requirements Analysis, Research Plan, Work Plan, this Step Breakdown, Access Matrix Template) created by PM (Gemini 2.5 Pro).

**Estimated Total Project Cost (from Work Plan):** €9.20

**Step 1: Initiate Research Phase & IMAP Website Analysis**

*   **Description:** Gemini 1.5 Flash (Researcher) begins the research tasks as outlined in `RESEARCH_PLAN.md`. The first priority is to analyze the IMAP website (if a URL is found or provided by the user later) and general landing page best practices.
*   **Lead Agent(s):** Gemini 1.5 Flash
*   **Supporting Agent(s):** N/A for initial website analysis, but other agents will be involved in later research tasks (e.g., brainstorming).
*   **Inputs:** `RESEARCH_PLAN.md`, `REQUIREMENTS_ANALYSIS.md`, User brief (for IMAP context).
*   **Outputs:** 
    *   Summary of IMAP website analysis (key findings, visual style, philosophy representation, ant metaphor usage).
    *   Initial findings on landing page best practices for transformation services.
*   **Key Tool(s) / Action(s):** `Search the internet with Serper` (to find IMAP website if URL not directly provided, and for best practices), `Scrape Website Content Tool` (to analyze IMAP site content), `Text Summarization Tool` (to condense findings).
*   **Estimated Cost for this Step:** €0.75 (0.25 for IMAP search/scrape, 0.50 for best practices research)
*   **Estimated Timeline:** 1-2 work cycles (PM to monitor)

**Step 2: Democratic Decision Preparation - Technical Architecture & Visuals**

*   **Description:** While research is ongoing, the PM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) prepares for the first set of democratic decisions. This involves formulating the precise questions and context for the decisions on Technical Architecture and Visual Style, based on the `REQUIREMENTS_ANALYSIS.md` and anticipating inputs from the `RESEARCH_PLAN.md`.
*   **Lead Agent(s):** Gemini 2.5 Pro (PM)
*   **Supporting Agent(s):** Grok (for potential pre-reflection on decision framing)
*   **Inputs:** `REQUIREMENTS_ANALYSIS.md`, `WORK_PLAN.md` (Phase 2 description).
*   **Outputs:** 
    *   Draft context and questions for the 'Technical Architecture' democratic decision.
    *   Draft context and questions for the 'Visual Style & Ant Metaphor' democratic decision.
*   **Key Tool(s) / Action(s):** Internal reasoning and text generation by PM. Potentially `Facilitate Reflection Tool` if early input from Grok is desired on framing.
*   **Estimated Cost for this Step:** €0.15 (PM processing, potential light reflection cost)
*   **Estimated Timeline:** Concurrent with parts of Step 1.

**Step 3: Research Sharing & Synthesis**

*   **Description:** Gemini 1.5 Flash presents all research findings (IMAP analysis, best practices, initial ideas on ant metaphor/AI demo) to the entire team. The PM facilitates a brief session to ensure all agents understand the key takeaways and to synthesize these insights in preparation for the democratic decisions.
*   **Lead Agent(s):** Gemini 1.5 Flash (presenting), Gemini 2.5 Pro (facilitating)
*   **Supporting Agent(s):** All team members (Claude 4 Sonnet, Codestral, Mistral Medium, Grok)
*   **Inputs:** Completed research outputs from Step 1 and other research tasks in `RESEARCH_PLAN.md`.
*   **Outputs:** 
    *   Shared understanding of research across the team.
    *   Refined list of potential considerations for architecture and visual style.
*   **Key Tool(s) / Action(s):** Communication (internal team messaging). PM uses summarization and facilitation skills.
*   **Estimated Cost for this Step:** €0.20 (cost of dissemination and brief team discussion/synthesis - assuming efficient communication)
*   **Estimated Timeline:** Immediately following completion of all initial research tasks.

**Step 4: Trigger First Democratic Decision: Technical Architecture**

*   **Description:** The PM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) formally initiates the democratic decision process for the Technical Architecture of the landing page, using the prepared context and question. All agents are invited to submit their proposals.
*   **Lead Agent(s):** Gemini 2.5 Pro (PM)
*   **Supporting Agent(s):** All team members (as participants)
*   **Inputs:** Prepared decision context from Step 2, synthesized research insights from Step 3.
*   **Outputs:** 
    *   A new democratic decision process initiated.
    *   Notification to all agents to participate.
*   **Key Tool(s) / Action(s):** `Trigger Democratic Decision Tool`.
*   **Parameters for Tool:** 
    *   `conflict_type`: 'architecture_decision'
    *   `trigger_reason`: 'Initial project phase: Selecting the foundational technical architecture for the Meta-IMAP landing page.'
    *   `context`: (Detailed context including project goals, key requirements like showcasing democratic AI process, need for efficiency, and relevant research summaries regarding performance, ease of AI collaboration, etc. - to be finalized by PM based on Step 2 & 3 outputs).
    *   `participating_agents`: ['Claude 4 Sonnet', 'Codestral', 'Mistral Medium', 'Gemini 1.5 Flash', 'Grok', 'Gemini 2.5 Pro'] (or specific relevant subset if deemed appropriate, but full team for this key decision seems best).
*   **Estimated Cost for this Step:** €0.25 (cost of triggering the decision and initial agent notifications/processing)
*   **Estimated Timeline:** Immediately following Step 3.

**Remaining Estimated Budget after these initial steps:** €10.00 - (€0.10 (Phase 0) + €0.75 (Step 1) + €0.15 (Step 2) + €0.20 (Step 3) + €0.25 (Step 4)) = **€8.55** 
*(Note: Phase 0 cost of €0.10 for PM's initial planning is included here as already incurred by this point)*
